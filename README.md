## Getting Started
First, install all dependencies by running.
```bash
yarn install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

To run development, click on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to redirect to your browser to see the result. Recommended browser is Google Chrome. 

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
